text:Hello, Chief Cao.	labels:Joo, you're here.
text:I'm here today to see what kind of treatment you usually give to patients whose oral medication is not satisfactory. No.	labels:Usually a basic insulin is added, and then it's done.
text:Just a basic insulin. I can understand that you're a non-conforming patient with oral medication. Is that what you're giving the patient is oral plus basic treatment?	labels:The director is.
text:I'll check again with you. Here's the chief. How's the blood sugar control for this part of the patient?	labels:It's okay.
text:OKAY, OKAY.Chief Cao is okay with this part of the patient. Are you concerned about this part of the patient's blood sugar after your meal?	labels:You see some of the concerns you don't care about, and you mention that some of the patients are actually not very well controlled after dinner.
text:I can understand that some of these patients have poor post-dinner glucose control, and some of them have poor post-dinner glucose control.	labels:If the increase is around 4,34345 or so, that's about it.
text:The increase is quite high, as the Director noted in the clinical guidance for the conversion of a programme following the introduction of insulin into type II diabetes in 2017, where the optimal timing of the poor basic insulin control programme was also an empty three-month period. His patient met the standard, glucated or followed by an artificial target, if the patient had a basic insulin journal of more than 0.4 to 0.6 kg per kilogram, and, as you have just mentioned, some of the patients were more than four times the increase in post-dinner blood sugar, and this guide recommended that the patient be optimized to pre-insulin for every litre equal to 3 millor.Do you agree with the Director?	labels:There's a good plan, too. Can you elaborate on that?
text:In 2017, you also gave a lecture to Mr. Chu, three months after the patient used oral clothing and basics, and three months later, it met the criteria, but you also said that some of the patients had an increase after dinner and were more than 4.For this group of patients, if the patient ' s basic insulin diary is more than 0.4 - 0.6 units per kilogram of body weight, or if the after-food blood sugar increases more than 3 millimil per litre of this group of patients, can you see that the patient ' s oral plus base is optimized to pre-insulin? Do you agree with this?	labels:I'm pretty sure, because I didn't say you hadn't noticed.
text:Yes, thank you very much for your approval of one of the patients of pre-insulin. If there is a patient in your clinic, the blood sugar of the other patient you have just mentioned is greater than 4 millimir per litre, you can choose a patient who can use the oral plus base.	labels:So there's nothing wrong with that. I'd like to try after you're done.
text:All right, you're busy. I think you've got a lot of patients. I'll see you later.episode_done:True
