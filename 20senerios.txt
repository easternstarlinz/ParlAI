text: Mr. Ma, the last time Don visited you, he mentioned some of Germany ' s safety treatments. The incidence of sports halls is very, very low compared to the previous week ' s insulin enzyme in Germany.  labels: I've tried one or two cases before, but I think it has a very low incidence of low blood sugar.
text: Mr. Ma, are you saying that the incidence of low insulin sugar is really low?  labels: Yes, because clinically, we rarely see low blood sugar occurring from glycerin, and in outpatient wards very rarely from low blood sugar.
text: Yes, it is true that glycerine is also a good base insulin, but the current situation with regard to the use of basic insulin in China is a deficiency in per capita doses, resulting in low compliance rates and insufficient dose adjustment, mainly because of concerns about the incidence of low blood sugar.I don't think so.Although the incidence of low blood sugar is very low, as you said earlier, serious low blood sugar is irreversible for patients, as is the case with flying. Although mechanical accidents on aircraft are very low, we do not want to encounter them, as is the case with severe low blood sugar, which in one case is fatal to the patient, and there is time to show that there is a serious low blood sugar patient and that there is a risk of cardiovascular death, which is 3.8 times higher than the normal absence of low blood sugar risk, while the occurrence of low blood sugar at night increases the patient ' s fear of low blood sugar and, in serious cases, causes the patient to lose or even die at once.I don't think so.Another study, devote, mentioned to you last time by Don, we can reduce the risk of serious metro soup by 40 per cent compared to glycerine, and the risk of severe low blood sugar at night by 53 per cent.  labels: Your study of demo, its severe low blood sugar compared to glycerin, and its liquids, its severe low blood sugar incidence at night, have declined significantly, because this data is actually quite interesting to us.I don't think so.And then I look at it in clinical terms, because it's clinically accurate, and we see that it has a very low incidence of low blood sugar, because it has a similar incidence of basic insulin, and it has a very low incidence of low blood sugar as a whole. And as you told me today, I'm trying to feel it a few more times.
text: Thank you, Mr. Wang, that unit will be able to lend you today to resolve your doubts. As we said earlier, the plane is safe as a plane, and the glycerin is safe as a glycemic, but we in Germany can raise the level of safety to a higher level, we can provide our low blood sugar, we have a safe health escort for diabetic patients, and they ask you to try one or two cases at tomorrow's clinic.  labels: Okay, okay, I'll be at the clinic tomorrow if I have the right one, and I can look at it two times.
text: OK, I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you, Miss Wang.I don't think so.

text: Director, teacher, come to visit you today. The last time you visited you, you raised the question of accumulation in Degulin, right?  labels: Because I told you about your product or about the product of Notre Dame the last time you told me about it, I think the product is good, because I'm kind of sweet about some new products, but I've got one for you once a day, and he's not 42 hours a day, he's not going to believe it. I still have a problem with that, and see if you can give me some more details.
text: All right, Director, you think that the half-life of insulin in Insulin in Insulin may be 24 hours, and you think that there may be low blood sugar in clinical use?
I don't think so.
Can you do that? Yeah. Yeah.  labels: You said that.
text: Well, here's the thing, actually, we have two aspects of the drug's metabolic absorption in the body, one of its absorbors and the other of its clean-up.I don't think so.Insulin is especially injected under the skin, and the weekend period is mainly reflected in the process of drug absorption and not in the process of internal elimination.I don't think so.Insulin was actually eliminated in the body for only four to six minutes, so the time it worked with insulin in the body was one of its medications, and the half-life of the weekend, as we said, was mainly reflected in its absorption process.I don't think so.You know that whether it's glycerin or insulin, including our latest insulin, it's a long-lived insulin, which is injected under the skin into the body to form a soluble polysulphite, it's half-life over the weekend, it's a mechanism for prolonged half-life in the process of absorption, and it doesn't work under the skin, and it doesn't cause low blood sugar reactions.I don't think so.In fact, from the clinical point of view, first of all, the negative effects of his renewal, which you have just mentioned is a low blood sugar, and in many experiments it can be confirmed, whether it's good for rct or for the real world, that the risk of his low blood sugar occurring is obvious, that there is no difference between the treatment and recovery of low blood sugar below glycerin and glycerin, so that the time it takes to recover is similar, so that although we have a half-life of 20 to 25 hours, we have a similar risk that it will not accumulate in the body after injection.
I don't think so.Chief, I don't know if I can explain this.   labels: I think I get it, which means that your insulin is a horizontal elimination rate that is in your body and is sought for first-level motor elimination, right? Then you explain this to me, which is how you open up and have some advantages over gluten, right? How much do you borrow for your health insurance now?
text: The director says that your problem is very good. In fact, the price is really related to the financial nature of our patients' use. Tegiya Insulin has been insured. After the implementation of the new health insurance policy in January 2020, there is Tegiya Insulin, which is 190, uh, 191.  labels: Right.
text: He is already insured, and there is no difference in use to other insulin, and the glycerin, including Dieter, is, after all, also admitted to the health insurance as a new possibility, suggesting that his recognition is still high at all levels.  labels: Do you have any data on clinical use, some evidence or something, or do you have anything on your side? Or do you have any samples or something on your side, and can I try it first, and I want to see what the clinical effect is?
text: Yes, you mentioned the samples, and I'd like to see two samples of his insulin here, and I'll bring them to you next time, especially if the glycerin has been fully adjusted, so that we can fully experience the advantages of the gluten and, on the one hand, the information you have, so that next time you can read some of his clinical ST studies, including those of the real world, together.
I don't think so.Is that all right with you, chief?  labels: Yes, I can. Then when you get it, I'll give some patients a trial, and I want to see what's going on.
text: All right, this is how you treat patients who have not met the criteria for blood sugar for more than six months, especially glycerin, so we can try it and experience it.
I don't think so.All right, thank you, Director. I'll be back next Monday.  labels: Well, bring it to me when you're ready. I'll try it on then, okay?
text: Good Director.  labels: Goodbye, Director Jang. Goodbye.I don't think so.

text: I haven't used the sample I took the other day. I was wondering if you German you've been telling me for 42 hours, and if you've been fighting once a day, will it produce savings?  labels: Thank you very much for your attention to our Germany and for your support, and I'm trying to understand the question you just said. Are you worried that we'll be working for 42 hours, uh, once a day, and then lead to a low blood sugar reaction?
text: Yes, if you want to accumulate, you're particularly vulnerable to low blood sugar.  labels: Yes, sir, in response to your question, I would like to communicate with you in a number of ways, and I would also like to be able to dispel your doubts.I don't think so.First of all, you fear that accumulation is actually a reaction of low blood sugar to the drug, which, according to research from both the rct and the real world, is significantly lower than glycerine, whether it is severe low blood sugar or severe low blood sugar at night. So you don't have to worry about his low blood sugar reaction, and there will be no accumulation in the valley anyway.I don't think so.
Second, Deguest insulin, as you know, has a half-life of 25 hours, and the drug half-life is basically divided into absorption half-life and elimination half-life. By insulin injected under the skin, the half-life is essentially a process of drug absorption, rather than a process of drug elimination, which means that one half-life of these 25 hours is mainly a process of under-absorption.I don't think so.You know that the main extension of insulin in our long-acting insulin is reflected in a process of absorption of insulin under its skin. The main extension of insulin under its skin is also formed into a soluble six-polymer long chain, and the insulin in its subsurface storage is virtually non-sugar-reducing, and only when our insulin receptor is inhaled with blood will it become sugar-resistance with the receptor. So when you look at insulin entering the internal blood cycle, the elimination process will not accumulate for only 4-6 minutes.I don't think so.Insulin is followed by the first degree of kinetic elimination, i.e. horizontal elimination, which can be completely metabolized after a single injection of three to five half-lives. And repeated injections of insulin are still in effect, and the amount of insulin in subcutaneous reservoirs and the amount of our inhaled blood is constant or non-accumulative. You can be assured of its use.I don't think so.

text: The director is busy. You have a lot of patients today. I'll get you a glass of hot water.  labels: Thank you, Choi.
text: I see that we've been using a lot of glycerine recently. Our company has not produced a new glycerine, which is also a long-lived base insulin. Now that I have brought you a few samples, it has entered the National Health Insurance, which is similar to the price of a reimbursement policy for glycerin, and if a patient who needs the initial base insulin can try it, his emptied blood sugar control will be much better than glycerin insulin.  labels: I've heard about it in Germany, like it has a lower risk of low blood sugar, right?
text: The Director is right. Thank you for your attention to our new drug. All the lct experiments and real world studies on the insulin skin of Devereaux have found that the risk of low blood sugar is significantly lower than that of glycerin.  labels: But we're good with glycerine, we're good with blood sugar, and very few patients have low blood sugar.
text: While it is clear that the director has been on the market for glyclinol for so many years and that it is now more widely applied in the clinical field, look at our biggest real world study in China, oppo, which shows that almost 20,000 patients in the group have an empty stomach of only about 40 per cent, and I think this also represents a general situation in China, where the average dose of basic insulin is 0.18 kilograms of body weight, with very few dose adjustments prior to and after the visit, and I think we are afraid of low blood sugar, so concerns about low blood sugar can also affect our clinical dose adjustment, thus affecting the efficacy of treatment.  labels: The dosage is too low for low blood sugar, but the patients here are still able to control it.
text: We all have higher levels of teachers and more regular management, but with regard to low blood sugar, we can't underestimate its risks, especially severe low blood sugar, and low blood sugar that happens at night when patients are unconscious.I don't think so.Although the incidence of these serious incidents is not high, as is the case with air accidents, it happens occasionally, with severe Earth patients, who are 3.8 times more likely to die from blood-smoking diseases than ordinary patients, with severe blood sugar at night if it occurs or irreversibly, and much less likely to reduce the patient’s expectations of treatment and dependence. Our Devote experiment in Devote in Insulin confirms that serious low blood sugar is occurring in the Valley, with a 40% lower risk than glycerin, and a 53% reduction in the risk of severe low blood sugar occurring at night.I don't think so.The ninth sugar is also related to the Insulin Insulin Review, which is more evenly distributed indoors, reducing the risk of blood sugar fluctuations and reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications among patients.I don't think so.If you look at the same price and reimbursement policy now, you can rest assured that you have some good cases, and we'll ask you to speak to the other doctors at our next meeting.  labels: Let's take a look at the original version of Devote and some of your relevant experimental information.I don't think so.
text: In addition to the devote experiment that we have just introduced to you, we have an excellent experiment, which is a real world study that shows that, even when patients who used basic insulin, including glyph insulina configurations, etc., are converted to the delta valley, the empty stomach is reduced by 1.5 millimil per litre. I will also take a copy of the text of our pkpt, and I say that day-to-day variability in both day-to-day distribution and sugar treatment is much better than glycerin.  labels: Okay, you bring it next time, okay.
text: Thank you, Director. Don't forget, if you need anything, that basic insulin patients can try to use a sample of Deokyeon, bye-bye.  labels:I don't think so.

text: How do you do, Chief Cao?  labels: You're here, Joo.
text: I come to see your director today what kind of program you usually use to treat patients who do not meet the criteria for oral treatment. No.  labels: A basic insulin is usually added, and then becomes available.
text: Just one basic insulin. I can understand that you're a patient who doesn't have the standard for oral medication. Is that what you're giving the patient is oral plus basic treatment?  labels: Yes, Director.
text: Yeah, I'll check again with you. Here's the chief. How's the blood sugar control for this part of the patient?  labels: It's okay.
text: All right, all right.I don't think so.Chief Cao is okay with this part of the patient. Are you concerned about this part of the patient's blood sugar after your meal?  labels: You see that some of the concerns are not, and you mention that some of the patients are actually not very well controlled after dinner.
text: Chief, I understand that some of the patients in this group have poor post-dinner glucose control, and some of the patients have poor post-dinner glucose control. Have you ever been aware of any specific cases where there has been an increase in glucose from individual patients? Can I ask you a question?  labels: If the increase is around 4,34345 or so, that's about it.
text: The increase is quite high, as noted by the Director in his clinical guidance for the conversion of a programme following the introduction of insulin into type II diabetes in 2017. The timing of the optimisation of the low-control programme on basic insulin is also an empty three-month period, and his patient has met the standard, glucose or dietary standards, if the patient ' s basic insulin journal is more than 0.4 to 0.6 kg/kg per kilogram, and, as you have just mentioned, some of the patients in this group have increased their blood sugar by more than four per millimeter, and this guide recommends that the patient be optimized to pre-insulin at a time equal to 3 millor per litre.I don't think so.Do you agree with the Director?  labels: There's a good plan, too. Can you elaborate on that?
text: In 2017, you also gave a lecture to Mr. Chu. Three months is for patients to use oral and basics. Three months later, an empty stomach meets the criteria, but you also said that some of the patients had an increase after dinner and were more than four.I don't think so.For this group of patients, if the patient ' s basic insulin diary is more than 0.4 - 0.6 units per kilogram of body weight, or if the after-food blood sugar increases more than 3 millimil per litre of this group of patients, can you see that the patient ' s oral plus base is optimized to pre-insulin? Do you agree with this?  labels: I'm pretty sure, because I didn't say you hadn't noticed before, but actually number three takes care of the size or you can think about your pre-insulin.
text: Yes, thank you very much for your approval of one of the patients of pre-insulin. The director of pre-insulin. If there is a patient in your clinic, you can select a patient who can use the oral plus base, if the other patient you have just mentioned is already more than 4 millimel per litre.  labels: So there's nothing wrong with it. I'd like to try it after you're done.
text: Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you very much, Director. Okay.  labels: I'll know when you get there.
text: You're busy. I see you have a lot of patients. See you later.  labels: bye.

text: Liu, when you say you've been working for 42 hours, I'm afraid that if he injects it once a day, he will be able to accumulate in the body.  labels: You're on your side about a resonance of No and D in your body, are you worried about the patient's reaction to a low-blood sugar, fearing that the patient will use No and D, and then produce an accumulation in your body, and then cause it to react to a low-blood sugar at the time of the next injection, is that what it looks like?I don't think so.There are real concerns about the fact that we are concerned about you being a clinical doctor. So No and Dat's half-life is 20, 24 hours, so let's take a look at it through his pharmacological and pharmacological dynamics, and I'll explain it to you slowly, and sometimes we call it half-life, half-life, and sometimes we call it consumption half-life or plasma half-life in the clinical, and it's a reaction to a stable blood dose, a 50% reduction in the time, right?I don't think so.Then, in fact, we all follow in our bodies a phase-out elimination ratio of primary mechanics, which basically eliminates the basic half-life of three to five units from the body after a single injection. The figure shows you, as you see it, the elimination of one half-life, and when we go back to three to five small half-lives, a dose of insulin stored under its skin is no longer increasing, and the dose of the drug is equivalent to the amount of blood lost from the under-skin storage reservoir, thus reaching a steady state.I don't think so.This means that when basic insulin is injected several times and three to five half-lives have reached a steady state, the base of the concentration remains unchanged, meaning that it does not produce an accumulation.I don't think so.So, at the same time, you see the Director through a theory from which we look at the map, the half-life of Nord-Da is about 25 hours, so that when a steady state is reached every day, an insulin is released into the blood, which produces an effective blood concentration and is maintained within the expected range, it also does not give rise to a continuation.
And we've done a lot of research in the middle of the clinic, and I know that if insulin is concentrated in the body, the reaction is mostly low blood sugar, right? So we've got a few rct studies, for example, some of them in the real world, whether it's a serious low blood sugar, or a symptomatic low blood sugar at night, including some of the overall low blood sugar, which is much lower than glycerin compared to Rhoda and glycerin, so the Director doesn't know if you have any more doubts about the explanation I've given you for this recollection.
text: Okay, I get it, I get it when you say it.  labels: Well, thanks to the director, and then if you're saying that we're here because No and Da Cynic may also be a new type of insulin, and the teachers' clinical experience is not good, then if there's a patient in need of it, then I'm going to have the Director's experience in this and if there's any question about it in the future, why don't you ask me about Liu and try to find my medical consultant in the company or some documents, including some of these intellectual papers, and bring them to the director?
text: Yes.I don't think so.

text: Hello, Mr. Chu. I've come to bring you two samples of Notre Dame. I'd like to give you a try. I shared some basic knowledge of Notre Dame's products with you the last time.I don't think so. understand your problem, Mr. Chu, but you still have some questions about whether a daily insulin injection in Tegiya could cause a vacuum, don't you?  labels: Yes.
text: Thank you very much, too, for your concern about insulin in Tegiya, which is also a question raised by many teachers.I don't think so.This is about the concept of a weekend half-life, which means that the insulin half-life reaction that we inject under our skin is a drug-absorption process, not a blood-eradication process, as you should have known before.This would explain why the main extension mechanism for insulin is actually a multimagnosis-specific constant under the skin, which is reflected in China's half-life as a drug absorption process, so that it is stored in a submersible reservoir, where it does not play a degenerative role.  labels:I don't think so.
text:So, from this point of view, it's possible to remove a part of it, and I'll go back to you again in detail. As insulin enters the human body, the process of blood circulation is four to six minutes, i.e., the insulin monomer, which, in fact, follows the first degree of glycodynamics, which is what we call the constant rate elimination, and the three to five half-half-life of each injection can be completely metabolized, that is, after three to five and a half months, we can achieve a stable process.  labels:I don't think so.
text:In simple terms, how much do we get in, for example, when I hit 10 units, it may be that 10 units are consumed, that is, the speed of the fight and the speed of consumption is constant and a stable state of drug concentration is also one aspect of the failure to accumulate in the Valley.  labels:I don't think so.

text: Little Jang and Da and Glyph insulin have similar effects, I think. And both have the same kung fu, basically no difference.  labels: The chief is concerned that No and Da are also similar to base insulin, the efficacy of which is between glycerin and insulin, which means that the advantages of reducing sugarification and empty stomachs are not particularly obvious, do you mean?
text:The chief is concerned that No and Da are also similar to base insulin, the efficacy of which is between glycerin and insulin, which means that the advantages of reducing sugarification and empty stomachs are not particularly obvious, do you mean? label: Yes.
text: I can understand that, because Nord and Da are, after all, a brand-new basic insulin analogue on the market, what we say about clinically used cases or clinically used experiences is also relatively new. So we have some and sufficient evidence-based medical evidence, both at home and abroad, that supports it. So, first of all, I would like to present you with a rct study of Nord and Da, as well as more research in the knowledge world.So first, let's look at the Rct study, which means that two groups of controls are going to reach the same level of glucose hemoglobin, and then compare them to a lower level of abdominal reduction. So we can see in the five studies that, compared to glyph insulin, the lower abdominal glucose is clearly better than the lower abdominal glucose, which means that no and da are better than glycine insulin. Then, back to our real world research, it is also clear that the lower abdominium is also better than glyclinic insulin.In addition to this, our eu study shows that, in relation to the use of other basic insulins, including glyclin, which are not well controlled, it can be converted into glyclinic insulin, and it can further reduce the amount of glycene 0.5 to the soup finger, as well as the amount of emptied haemorrhage per litre of his patients. Once again, it is clear that in reducing abdominal and glucone, the efficacy of our insulin is better than glycine insulin.You see the director's concern about this study, see if I can explain it, or do you have any other questions?
text: For the time being, it's not a problem, it's probably a new drug, and we're not very experienced with it, so it's probably just like single glycerin insulin. But do you have any originals for these studies?  labels: Good Director, that's what I'd like to tell you. It might be easier if you were in the ward tomorrow. I'll bring you the background and data of some of these specific studies, his originals, and we'll do some more analysis and research together.
text: Yes, I'll be fine after 9 a.m. tomorrow. You can bring it to me, and then you can say that I'll look for you again if the drug is used in our section later.  labels: Director of Good Lines.
